# Marketing Agency Niche Research
## How to Stand Out in 2024-2025

## The Current Landscape

**Oversaturated niches (avoid or differentiate hard):**
- General "social media management"
- Generic "digital marketing"
- "We do everything for everyone"

**Underserved niches (opportunity):**
- AI integration specialists
- Industry-specific verticals
- Performance-based pricing

## Ways to Stand Out

### 1. Vertical Specialization
**Instead of:** "We do marketing for businesses"
**Be:** "We help SaaS companies reduce churn through lifecycle email marketing"

**Hot verticals for 2024-2025:**
- AI/ML startups
- Fintech / Trading
- Healthcare tech
- E-commerce (DTC brands $1M-$10M)

### 2. Service Specialization
- Video ads for e-commerce
- AI implementation
- Conversion rate optimization
- Email marketing
- LinkedIn organic + ads
- TikTok/Short-form content

### 3. Pricing Model Differentiation
- Performance-based (% of revenue)
- Productized services (fixed scope/price)
- Retainer + Equity
- Subscription model

### 4. AI-First Positioning
"Traditional agencies charge for hours. We charge for outcomes."
